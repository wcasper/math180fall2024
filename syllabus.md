## Policies and expectations
I reserve the right to adjust the policies in this syllabus on a case-by-case basis.

**E-mail**
Please email me from your CSU Fullerton account, as other email addresses may be filtered into my Spam folder.

Allow me 24 hours to respond to your email before sending a follow-up email. My response time may be slower in the evenings or over weekends.

**Attendance and Participation**
If you miss any classes during the first week without notifying the instructor or the departmental office within 24 hours of the meeting, you may be dropped from the course.

Attendance and class participation are important components for success in this course. We will work through assigned in-class problems during our meetings.

You will be expected to work in groups on in-class assignments. Be respectful, and make sure all team members have completed the task. The teamwork grade will be factored into the participation grade.

You may also be asked to post in the Discussion Board. Before doing so, review the Forum Rules on our Canvas course site.


**Assigned Readings**
You will be assigned a few sections of material to read prior to most class meetings. These are crucial for your understanding of the material in lectures and participation in in-class assignments.


**Homework**
Weekly homework assignments should be uploaded to Canvas in a PDF format.
Three possible ways of accomplishing this (in order of preference) are
* typing your solution in LaTeX on Overleaf and then compiling and downloading the resultant pdf.
* writing your solution and using a scanner or smartphone to scan it as a PDF document and upload it
* using some other word processor such as Microsoft Word to create the document and then export it as a PDF

**Seminars:**
As part of this class, you will be expected to attend a seminars within the department at least three times throughout the semester and create a discussion post about what you learned, and more importantly, what questions it made you ask.  Examples of department seminars include
* Problem Solving Seminar: this seminar is about solving math puzzles and other contest problems, and preparing for a legendary math competition called the Putnam Exam
* Algebra/Geometry/Topology Seminar: this seminar focuses on current research in algebra, geometry, and topology by working mathematicians
* Analysis Seminar: this seminar focuses on current research in analysis by working mathematicians
* Applied Mathematics Seminar: this seminar focuses on current research in applied mathematics by working mathematicians

Note that going above and beyond in this requirement constitutes an opportunity for **extra credit**!  (Examples include attending more than the required seminars, presenting in a seminar, engaging in other extra-curricular mathy activities, etc).
Also, if you are unable to attend any seminar at least three times due to scheduling issues, you may request accommodation in the form of supplementary activities like writing a report on an interesting math topic.
This request should happen as early as possible and requests occuring in the last few weeks of class which appear to be about procrastination will be viewed disfavorably.

**Research:**
As part of this class, you will be responsible for conducting and presenting a **research project** where you try to answer some question that nobody knows the answer to yet.  It can be inspired by a project we do in class, or by some of your interests outside of class.  This project will culminate in the creation of a research poster that you will use to present your work in a class-wide poster session.

___


## Exams
**Final Exam**
The final exam will be cumulative with both written and computational parts, and will account for 20% of your grade.

* If your section is 10-12 on T/Th, then your Final Exam time is **9-11AM** on **Tuesday, December 12**
* If your section is 12-2  on T/Th, then your Final Exam time is **1-3PM** on **Tuesday, December 12**

## Academic integrity
Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary sanctions, including failure in the course and suspension from the university. Since dishonesty in any form harms the individual, other students, and the university, policies on academic integrity are strictly enforced. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
1. copying from another student's homework, quiz, or exam;
2. allowing another student to copy your work; and
3. copying homework solutions from online.

You should familiarize yourself with the academic integrity guidelines found in the current student handbook.  Consult the <a target="_parent" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf">University Policy Statement (UPS) 300.021 regarding Academic Dishonesty (link)</a> for details.
