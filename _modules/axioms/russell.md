## First, a riddle

> The barber shaves every man who does not shave himself. Who shaves the barber?


## Next, a crack in the very foundations of all of Logic and Mathematics

<p>So the story goes, a renowned and brilliant philosopher and logician, <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gottlob Frege</a>, sought to provide a complete and airtight foundation for all of Mathematics using pure logic. He had completed a draft of his epic work, sent it to some notable mathematicians for review, and received a note on a single postcard from <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bertrand Russell</a>, which brought the entire endeavor to a screeching halt.</p>


Consider the set $$R = \{x: x\notin x\}$$.

Is $$R$$ a member of itself, i.e. is $$R\in R$$?

* If so, then $$R$$ fails to satisfy the condition of membership, so $$R$$ cannot be a member of itself.
* But if $$R$$ is not a member of itself, then it satisfies the condition for membership, so it must be a member of itself!
