## The MIU-axiomatic system

The MIU-axiomatic system starts with undefined objects M, I, and U.  It also has defined objects called strings which are built out of the unknowns using the following axioms.

* Axiom 1: MI is a string in the MIU-system
* Axiom 2: if x is a string in the MIU-system ending in I, then xU is a string in the MIU-system
* Axiom 3: if x is any string (not necessarily in the MIU-system) and Mx is a string in the MIU-system, then Mxx is a string in the MIU-system
* Axiom 4: if III occurs anywhere in a string in the MIU-system, replacing III by U is also a string in the MIU-system
* Axiom 5: if UU occurs anywhere in a string in the MIU-system, removing UU results in a new string in the MIU-system

**Problem 1:**

For each of the following strings, use Axioms to show that the string must be in any model of the the MIU-system or explain why it may not be.

* (a) MUI
* (b) MIUUI
* (c) MIUUIU
* (d) UM
* (e) MUIU
* (f) MUIIU
* (g) MU
* (h) M

## A Putnam set of natural numbers

We call a set of natural numbers $$S$$ a "Putnam set" if it satisfies the following three axioms.
* (A1) 2 is in S,
* (A2) $$n$$ is in $$S$$ whenever $$n^2$$ is in $$S$$, and
* (A3) $$(n + 5)^2$$ is in $$S$$ whenever $$n$$ is in $$S$$.

**Problem 2:**

* (a) Is there at least one Putnam set of integers? In other words, is there at least one model for this axiomatic system?
* (b) Is there more than one Putnam set of integers?  In other words, is there more than one model?
* (c) If $$S$$ is a Putnam set of integers, what integers are guaranteed to belong to $$S$$, based on these axioms?


## Peano Axioms

Use the Peano Axioms to prove each of the following.

* (a) $$1\neq 2$$
* (b) $$1\neq 3$$ and $$2\neq 3$$
