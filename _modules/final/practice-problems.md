## True or False

* The empty set is a subset of every set
* The empty set is an element of every set
* There is a surjective map from the set of the standard $$52$$ playing cards to the set of U.S. states
* There is a surjective map from the set of the standard $$52$$ playing cards to the set of integers $$1,2,\dots,13$$
* We use axiomatic set theory to get around problems with paradoxes introduced by naive set theory, such as Russel's paradox

## Example Section
For each of the following problems, give an example 

* A partition of 10
* A set with exactly $$99$$ elements
* Sets $$A$$ and $$B$$ such that *simultaneously* $$B\subseteq A$$ and $$B\in A$$
* A function which is injective but not bijective
* A function which is surjective but not bijective
* Five different sets, all of which are countably infinite
* An uncountable set
* A set whose cardinality is larger than $$\mathbb R$$


## Comparing Sizes
For each of the following, determine which set is bigger.  If they are the same size, then write that they are equal.

* The set $$\{1,\heartsuit,\Delta\}$$ or the set $$\{\{1,\heartsuit,\Delta\},2,\diamondsuit\}.$$
* The set of $$M$$ of living or dead (biological) human mothers or the set $$C$$ of living or dead (biological) human children
* The set $$\mathbb N$$ of natural numbers of the set $$\mathbb Q$$ of rational numbers
* The set $$(0,1)$$ of real numbers between $$0$$ and $$1$$ or the set $$\mathbb R$$ of all real numbers
* The set $$\{\mathbb R,\mathbb Z\}$$ or the set $$B$$ of all even integers.
