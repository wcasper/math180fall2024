## True or False

* The empty set is a subset of every set
TRUE, by definition!
* The empty set is an element of every set
FALSE, though it is true sometimes!
* There is a surjective map from the set of the standard $$52$$ playing cards to the set of U.S. states
TRUE, for there to be a surjection the domain must have cardinality greater than or equal to the codomain.
* There is a surjective map from the set of the standard $$52$$ playing cards to the set of integers $$1,2,\dots,13$$
TRUE, since the cardinality of the domain is larger than the cardinality of the codomain.  One example is the function sending every card to its face value (A=1,J=11,Q=12,K=13)
* We use axiomatic set theory to get around problems with paradoxes introduced by naive set theory, such as Russel's paradox
TRUE, as discussed in class and in Gallery of the Infinite

## Example Section
For each of the following problems, give an example 

* A partition of 10

$$(3,3,3,1)$$

* A set with exactly $$99$$ elements
Instead of writing one out, let's use set builder notation!

$$\{x : x\in \mathbb N,\ 1\leq x\leq 99\}.$$

* Sets $$A$$ and $$B$$ such that *simultaneously* $$B\subseteq A$$ and $$B\in A$$

$$B = \{1\},\ \ A = \{1,2,3,\{1\}\}.$$

* A function which is injective but not bijective

$$f: \{1,2,3\}\rightarrow \{1,2,3,4\},\ \ f(k) = k$$

* A function which is surjective but not bijective

$$f: \mathbb R\rightarrow [0,\infty),\ \ f(x) = x^2$$

* Five different sets, all of which are countably infinite

$$\mathbb{N},\ \mathbb{Z},\ \mathbb{Q},\ \mathbb {Z}^2,\ \{x: x\ \text{is an even integer}\}.$$

* An uncountable set

$$\mathbb R$$

* A set whose cardinality is larger than $$\mathbb R$$

$$\mathcal P(\mathbb R)$$

## Comparing Sizes
For each of the following, determine which set is bigger.  If they are the same size, then write that they are equal.

* The set $$\{1,\heartsuit,\Delta\}$$ or the set $$\{\{1,\heartsuit,\Delta\},2,\diamondsuit\}.$$

They have the same size!

* The set of $$M$$ of living or dead (biological) human mothers or the set $$C$$ of living or dead (biological) human children

The set of children is larger than the set of mothers since each child has a mother but mothers can have multiple children.

* The set $$\mathbb N$$ of natural numbers of the set $$\mathbb Q$$ of rational numbers

They set of rational numbers is countable, so they must have the same cardinality.

* The set $$(0,1)$$ of real numbers between $$0$$ and $$1$$ or the set $$\mathbb R$$ of all real numbers

They have the same cardinality, as we showed in class.  Do you remember how?

* The set $$\{\mathbb R,\mathbb Z\}$$ or the set $$B$$ of all even integers.

The first set only has two elements! Therefore the set $$B$$ is larger.
