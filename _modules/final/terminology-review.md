## Definitions

* A **set** is a collection $$A$$ of objects, called elements.
* A **subset** $$B$$ of $$A$$ is a set with the property that every element of $$B$$ is also an element of $$A$$
* The **power set** of $$A$$ is the set of all subsets of $$A$$
* A composition of $$n$$ is a sequence of positive integers which add up to $$n$$
* A partition of $$n$$ is a decreasing sequence of positive integers which add up to $$n$$
* A **function** $$f$$ from $$A$$ to $$B$$ is something which assigns every element $$x$$ of $$A$$ to an element $$f(x)$$ of $$B$$
* If $$f$$ is a function from $$A$$ to $$B$$ then $$A$$ is called the **domain** and $$B$$ is called the **codomain**.
* A function $$f$$ from $$A$$ to $$B$$ is **injective** or **one-to-one** if given $$x_1,x_2\in A$$ with $$x_1\neq x_2$$ we must have $$f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)$$
* A function $$f$$ from $$A$$ to $$B$$ is **surjective** or **onto** if for every $$y\in B$$ there is some $$x\in A$$ with $$f(x) = y$$
* A function $$f$$ from $$A$$ to $$B$$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective
* A set $$A$$ has **cardinality less than** a set $$B$$ if there exists an injective function from $$A$$ to $$B$$.
* A set $$A$$ has **cardinality greater than** a set $$B$$ if there exists a surjective function from $$A$$ to $$B$$.
* A set $$A$$ has **cardinality equal to** a set $$B$$ if there exists a bijective function from $$A$$ to $$B$$.
* A set is called **finite** if it has finitely many elements
* A set is called **infinite** if it has infinitely many elements
* A set is called **countable** if it is finite or else has the same cardinality as $$\mathbb N$$
* A set is called **countably infinite** if it is both countable and infinite, or equivalently if it has the same cardinality as $$\mathbb N$$
* A set is called **uncountable** if it is not countable

## Notation

* $$\mathbb{N}$$ is the set of natural numbers
* $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is the set of integers
* $$\mathbb{Q}$$ is the set of rational numbers
* $$\mathbb{R}$$ is the set of real numbers
* $$x\in A$$ means that $$x$$ is an element of $$A$$
* $$A\subseteq B$$ means that $$A$$ is a subset of $$B$$
* $$f: A\rightarrow B$$ means that $$f$$ is a function from $$A$$ to $$B$$
* $$\lvert A\rvert$$ means the number of elements in the set $$A$$ or the "cardinality" of $$A$$
* $$\mathcal P(A)$$ means the power set of $$A$$
