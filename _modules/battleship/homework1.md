### Problem 1 
Consider, first, a single 2x1 ship on a 3x3 board as in the game Battleship.

* (A) Considering all possible ways of arranging a single 2x1 ship on a 3x3 board, what are the probabilities, for each spot, that a ship lies on that spot?
* (B) After an initial shot has been fired at the most probable spot on the board and it did not hit what are the new probabilities, for each spot, that a ship lies on that spot?
* (C) If the second shot is fired at A1 and misses, then what are the probabilities, for each spot, that a ship lies on that spot?
* (D) If the second shot is, instead, fired at A2 and misses, then what are the probabilities, for each spot, that a ship lies on that spot?
* (E) Discuss which would be a better strategy, to take the second shot at A1 or at A2, based on the previous findings.

### Problem 2
Consider, now, a full-sized 10x10 board.

* (A) How many different ways are there to place a single 2x1 ship on a 10x10 board?
* (B) How many different ways are there to place a single 3x1 ship on a 10x10 board?
* (C) How many different ways are there to place both a 2x1 and a 3x1 ship on a 10x10 board, following the rules of Battleship ship placement?

### Problem 3
Use the [Battleship Simulator](https://wcasper.github.io/math180fall2024/modules/battleship/battleship-simulator) to find the best static firing sequence you can.
What is the best sequence you found, and how many shots on average did it take to sink the fleet?
