Grading the **final draft** will be based on the following:

Remember, the final draft of your report will be graded based on the following criteria:
* Readability (1-4): was the paper well-written?  Were there lots of spelling or grammar mistakes?  Was it well-formatted, or are things just thrown in willy-nilly?
* Mathematical accuracy (1-4):  does the math, computation, or code check out.  Are there mistakes?
* Depth (1-4): did we dive into and explore the problem in detail.  Is there obvious effort or is it clear that there is only a superficial investigation.
* Completeness (1-4): are the required sections in the report?  Is the content of each section what it should be, or is it lacking or missing entirely?
