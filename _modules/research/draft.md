Your assignment is to upload a pdf copy of the current draft of your research report.
Make sure that it has all of the required sections mentioned in <a href="report">Report</a>, though they do not need to be complete yet.

For an example template of your research report, please look at:
* <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWSsN8E-kkXG4sDCpcB1h9OTaHKD2ixrNvqBGZ0tMbo/edit?usp=sharing">example project report</a>

Grading the **rough draft** will be based on having *some more* content in place as well as all the required sections present in some form, which should be beginning to get filled out in detail.

Remember, the final draft of your report will be graded based on the following criteria:
* Readability (1-4): was the paper well-written?  Were there lots of spelling or grammar mistakes?  Was it well-formatted, or are things just thrown in willy-nilly?
* Mathematical accuracy (1-4):  does the math, computation, or code check out.  Are there mistakes?
* Depth (1-4): did we dive into and explore the problem in detail.  Is there obvious effort or is it clear that there is only a superficial investigation.
* Completeness (1-4): are the required sections in the report?  Is the content of each section what it should be, or is it lacking or missing entirely?
