**Question 1:**

Consider the collection of twelve cards below.

<p aligh="center">
<img src="fig/card-gsf1.gif" alt="green squiggle full single" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-rsh1.gif" alt="red squiggle striped single" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-psh3.gif" alt="purple squiggle striped triple" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-pse3.gif" alt="purple squiggle empty triple" style="width:20%">
</p>

<p aligh="center">
<img src="fig/card-rof3.gif" alt="red oval full triple" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-gtf2.gif" alt="green triangle full double" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-rte3.gif" alt="red triangle empty triple" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-pof3.gif" alt="purple oval full triple" style="width:20%">
</p>

<p aligh="center">
<img src="fig/card-rtf1.gif" alt="red triangle full single" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-goe3.gif" alt="green oval empty triple" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-roe1.gif" alt="red oval empty single" style="width:20%">
<img src="fig/card-gof3.gif" alt="green oval full triple" style="width:20%">
</p>

Find all the possible SETs in the above collection.

**Question 2:**

* (A) How many cards are in a full SET deck?  How can you figure this out without actually counting the cards in the deck (or reading the box)?
* (B) If you put all of the cards from the deck on the table at the same time, how many different SETs will there be?

**Question 3:**

With twelve cards out on the table, what is the largest number of distinct sets that could be found among the cards?

**Question 4:**

Find an example of twelve set cards which have no SETs.  How can you *prove* that there are no sets?  Be detailed.

**Question 5:**

Describe an interesting question or problem about the game SET.  Why is it interesting?  How could someone start to answer it?
