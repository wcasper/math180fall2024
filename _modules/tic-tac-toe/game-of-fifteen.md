### Rules
In the **Game of Fifteen**, two players take turns choosing numbers according to the following rules.

1. Each player takes turns choosing a whole number greater than $$0$$ and less than $$10$$.
2. Once a number has been chosen, it cannot be chosen again.
3. The first player to collect three numbers that add up to $$15$$ wins.
4. If all the numbers have been chosen and no player has won, then the game is a draw.

### Example

* Player 1 goes first and chooses number $$3$$ (from among $$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$$).
* Player 2 goes next  and chooses number $$5$$ (from among $$1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$$).
* Player 1 then chooses number $$8$$ (from among $$1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9$$).
* Player 2 then chooses number $$4$$ (from among $$1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9$$).
* Player 1 then chooses number $$6$$ (from among $$1, 2, 6, 7, 9$$).
* Player 2 then chooses number $$1$$ (from among $$1, 2, 7, 9$$).
* Player 1 then chooses number $$2$$ (from among $$2, 7, 9$$).
* Player 2 then chooses number $$9$$ (from among $$7, 9$$). They win, since they have now collected the three numbers $$9$$, $$5$$ and $$1$$ which add up to $$15$$.

**Note:** A player would not win by choosing just two numbers, such as $$7$$ and $$8$$, which add up to $$15$$.  It has to be a collection of three numbers which add up to $$15$$.
