### Game of Thirty-four
Similar to the Game of Fifteen, we can make the **Game of Thirty-four**, whose rules are very similar.

1. Each player takes turns choosing a number greater than $$0$$ and less than $$17$$.
2. Once a number has been chosen, it cannot be chosen again.
3. The first player to collect four numbers that add up to $$34$$ wins.
4. If all the numbers have been chosen and no player has won, then the game is a draw.

### The $$m,n,k$$-game
A more general variation of tic-tac-toe is the $$m,n,k$$-game.
The rules are identical, except it is played on an $$m\times n$$ grid rather than a $$3\times 3$$ grid, and the goal is to get $$k$$ in a row.

### Wild Tic-tac-toe
You play with the normal rules of Tic-tac-toe, except that on your turn you can decide to play either an X or an O.
The player that wins is the first one to complete three-in-a-row with any symbol.

### Misere Tic-tac-toe
In this variant, the player wins if their *opponent* gets three-in-a-row.

### 3-dimensional Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe, but played on a $$3$$-d board, like some kinda crazy Star Trek nonsense.

### Last One Wins Tic-tac-toe
Each turn a player can mark as many spaces as they want, as long as they all belong to the same row or column.
The objective is no longer to get three-in-a-row.  Instead, the player who wins is whoever fills in the final space in the board.

### Tic-Tac-Toe for a Crowd
This game works for three to six people. When you draw a tic-tac-toe board for a standard game, you draw two lines vertically and two lines horizontally to create a board with nine squares. For this game, you need a giant tic-tac-toe board that you draw with $$10$$ or so lines both vertically and horizontally. The exact number of lines you draw isn't important, just so the game board is BIG. Then each player chooses a different letter or symbol. The idea is the same as tic-tac-toe, except that instead of winning with three in a row, the winner has to get four in a row, horizontally, vertically, or on a diagonal.

### Tic-tac-tetris

This version is played on a $$5\times 5$$ grid and the goal is to get a Tetris shape.  Placement must be started on the bottom of the grid and you can only place other places by "stacking", just like in normal Tetris.
