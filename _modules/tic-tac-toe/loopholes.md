## Loopholes

* Create a variation of the game Tic-tac-toe
* Write down the rules for your new version on a single one-sided piece of paper.
* Pass your paper to another group and have them play the new version.
* Try to find a loophole to the rule set you recieve: a way to do something that you know you shouldn't be able to do in tic-tac-toe, but which technically obeys the rules that you came up with.
Whenever you find something, discuss it with your group members and explain what modifications of the rules you made in Part 1 are required to close the loophole.
* Now based on the other groups feedback, discuss what problems there were with your original rule set and how you would fix them.
* Scan and upload your original rules, what problems there were and how they were fixed, and a final set of rules for your version as a single PDF.
