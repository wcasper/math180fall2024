## Loopholes

* Carefully examine the rules that you created for tic-tac-toe.
Try to find a loophole: a way to do something that you know you shouldn't be able to do in tic-tac-toe, but which technically obeys the rules that you came up with.
Whenever you find something, discuss it with your group members and explain what modifications of the rules you made in Part 1 are required to close the loophole.

If your rules were ironclad in Part 1 and you cannot find any loopholes, then instead come up with a way that you can change the rules so that they still appear solid, but so there is a clever trick that you can now exploit to your advantage.
