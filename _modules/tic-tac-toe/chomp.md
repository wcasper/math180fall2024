### Chomp
The game **chomp** is played with two players, starting with an $m\times n$ grid of squares forming a chocolate bar.
* The players take turns choosing a block and taking a bite, which removes the chosen block along with all blocks below it, to the right of it, or both.
* On each turn, players must take a bite.
* The top left block is poisoned, and the player who eats this final block loses.

Play the divisor game for a while with various size grids.
Then discuss the following questions
1. Which player has an advantage?
2. Does one of the players have a perfect strategy thta will guarantee them a win?  Does the size of the board matter?
3. What about if you pick up a partially played game?  Who has the advantage?
