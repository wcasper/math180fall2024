Welcome to Math 180!  In this class we will learn mathematical strategies of problem solving through the lens of puzzles, games, and other problems.
We will also get some first-hand experience with abstract mathematics, including sets, functions, relations, and countability!

## First steps

Please familiarize yourself with the [syllabus (link)](https://wcasper.github.io/math180fall2024/syllabus) and the Canvas site for this course, starting with the [Orientation Module (link)](https://csufullerton.instructure.com/courses/3456916/modules/9068583). Also, be sure that you have the necessary technological requisites:

* A reliable internet connection

This class is highly interactive, and will require you to attend class meetings regularly and be engaged. Activities and other students' learning will depend on your participation!

We will also be using an array of tools throughout the semester, including VoiceThread, GoogleDocs, and external websites that will require creating accounts. We will discuss these tools in class as they become relevant.

Please reach out as soon as possible if you have any questions or concerns.
